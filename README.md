# Analysis of USA Presidential and Senate Elections (1976-2020)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the United States Presidential and Senate elections from 1976 to 2020, focusing on the Democratic and Republican parties at both the state and federal levels. Utilizing data visualization techniques, we explore voter engagement, economic trends, and historical voting patterns to understand the impact of political leadership on electoral outcomes and the country's economic health.

## Project Overview

### Figures

- **Figure 1**: Choropleth Map of 2020 Presidential Election Votes for Joe Biden
- **Figure 2**: Scatter Plot of Popular Votes in Presidential Elections (1976-2020)
- **Figure 3**: Time Series Graph of U.S. Economic Trends vs. Presidential Terms (1970-2020)

### Datasets

The analysis is based on datasets from Harvard's Dataverse and Kaggle:
- [Harvard Dataverse Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX)
- [Kaggle US Election 2020 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/us-election-2020)

### Tools and Libraries

- **Python Libraries**: Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
- **IDE**: Google Colab (Online Jupyter Notebook)
- **Visualization Functions**: `px.choropleth()`, `plt.plot()`, `plt.scatter()`

## Key Findings

1. **Electoral Engagement**: The choropleth map highlights voter engagement across different states in the 2020 Presidential election, emphasizing the democratic process's scale of participation.
2. **Economic and Political Correlation**: The line graph correlates GDP growth and unemployment rates with presidential terms, illustrating the impact of political leadership on the country's economic health.
3. **Historical Voting Patterns**: The scatter plot provides insights into the changing political inclinations of the electorate over several election years, useful for understanding shifts in party dominance and voter behavior.
4. **Economic Trend Visualization**: The combined graph of GDP and unemployment over time offers a nuanced understanding of economic performance over decades, against the backdrop of presidential terms.

## Significance

The presented figures offer a multi-dimensional view of the USA's political and economic landscape over nearly half a century, highlighting the interplay between electoral engagement, political leadership, and economic performance. These visualizations serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public interested in the dynamics of American democracy and economic trends.
